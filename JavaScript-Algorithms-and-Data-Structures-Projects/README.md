# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

In this section I had the chance to build the following projects:

1. Palindrome Checker - [See the code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Palindrome%20Checker/palindrome-checker.js)

In this section I will build the following projects:

- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesars Cipher
- Telephone Number Validator
- Cash Register

## Additional project

While working through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write an algorithm to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. I've decided to take this challenge a bit further and implement also an UI for it.
