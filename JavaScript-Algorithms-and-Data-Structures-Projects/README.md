# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

In this section I had the chance to build the following projects:

1. Palindrome Checker - [See the code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Palindrome%20Checker/palindrome-checker.js)

In this section I will build the following projects:

- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesars Cipher
- Telephone Number Validator
- Cash Register

## Additional projects _not required by the curriculum_

1. While working through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write an algorithm to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. I've decided to take this challenge a bit further and implement also an UI for it. - [Live Example on CodePen](https://codepen.io/alexandracaulea/full/rNVKLor) - [See the code on GitHub](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/tree/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Celsius%20to%20Fahrenheit%20Convertor)

2. Practice writing tests in Jest - I've took all the challenges from the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) that I've already solved and wrote tests in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - [See the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/Intermediate-Algorithm-Scripting).
